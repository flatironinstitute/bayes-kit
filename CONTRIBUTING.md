# Contributing to BridgeStan

We welcome contributions to the project and we could really use your help to:

* Investigate and fix reported bugs

* Improve the workflow

* Improve the documentation

* Increase test coverage


## Code format

We are using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the uncompromising code formatter.


## Typing

We are using the [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) static type checker

## Unit testing

We are using [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

## Git model

Our development process involves the following steps to add code.

1. create an issue on GitHub
2. develop the issue on a branch from `main`
    * code
    * unit tests
	* documentation
3. create a pull request for the branch
4. until accepted,
    * get a code review
    * fix pull request according to the reviewer's requests


## Documentation strings

BridgeStan uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate documentaiton.

We are following the

* [Google Stype Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html#example-google)
