    The R-hat value indicates how much the scale (i.e., standard

    reduced by running longer.  If all chains have converged to an
    equilibrium distribution, the value of R-hat will be 1; if they have
    not converged, R-hat will be greater than 1.  As chain length
    increases, R-hat will converge to 1 if the Markov chains are well
    behaved in the sense of having the correct stationary distribution.

    Suppose there are `M` chains of length `N[m]` each, with draws
    `chains[m, n]`.  In particular, note that `N`, `phi`, and `psi` are
