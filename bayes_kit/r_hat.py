def rhat(chains: list[VectorType]) -> FloatType:
    """
    Return the potential scale reduction factor (R-hat) for a list of Markov chains.

    If there are `M` chains of length `N[m]` each, with draws `theta[m, n]`,
    then `R-hat = sqrt((mean(N) - 1) / mean(N) + var(phi) / mean(psi))`, where
    `phi[m] = mean(chains[m])` and `psi[m] = var(chains[m])`.  This reduces to
    the standard definition when all chains are the same length.

    Parameters:
    chains: list of unary Markov chains

    Returns:
    R-hat

    Throws:
    ValueError: if there are fewer than two chains
